# WebAssembly Games

This repository has some games I'm written in Rust using the **stdweb**
library to convert them to WASM, so they can run in the browser.

I will load them in Demo Pages, but you try them out on your browser
cloning this repository, moving to a game folder and executing this command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jmpargana/webassembly_games.git
cd folder_name
cargo web start
```
